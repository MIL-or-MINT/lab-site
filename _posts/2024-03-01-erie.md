<!-- abstract -->

Data sonification&mdash;mapping data variables to auditory variables, such as pitch or volume&mdash;is used for data accessibility, scientific exploration, and data-driven art (e.g., museum exhibitions) among others. While a substantial amount of research has been made on effective and intuitive sonification design, software support is not commensurate, limiting researchers from fully exploring its capabilities. We contribute <i>Erie</i>, a declarative grammar for data sonification, that enables abstractly expressing auditory mappings. <i>Erie</i> supports specifying extensible tone designs (e.g., periodic wave, sampling, frequency/amplitude modulation synthesizers), various <i>encoding</i> channels, auditory legends, and <i>composition</i> options like sequencing and overlaying. Using standard Web Audio and Web Speech APIs, we provide an Erie compiler for web environments. We demonstrate the expressiveness and feasibility of Erie by replicating research prototypes presented by prior work and provide a sonification design gallery. We discuss future steps to extend <i>Erie</i> toward other audio computing environments and support interactive data sonification.
