<!-- abstract -->
Designing responsive visualizations can be cast as applying transformations to a source view to render it suitable for a different screen size. However, designing responsive visualizations is often tedious as authors must manually apply and reason about candidate transformations. We present Cicero, a declarative grammar for concisely specifying responsive visualization transformations which paves the way for more intelligent responsive visualization authoring tools. Cicero’s flexible *specifier* syntax allows authors to select visualization elements to transform, independent of the source view’s structure. Cicero encodes a concise set of *actions* to encode a diverse set of transformations in both desktop-first and mobile-first design processes. Authors can ultimately reuse design-agnostic transformations across different visualizations. To demonstrate the utility of Cicero, we develop a compiler to an extended version of Vega-Lite, and provide principles for our com- piler. We further discuss the incorporation of Cicero into responsive visualization authoring tools, such as a design recommender.
