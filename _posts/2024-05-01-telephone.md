caption: "The telephone framework for experimental design to determine effectiveness of a visual representation describes two possible pathways for what an experiment might be measuring. In this paper, we discuss how experiment designers might fall into the trap of calculating an incorrect measure, instead of the desired measure."

<!-- abstract -->

Empirical studies in visualisation often compare visual representations to identify the most effective visualisation for a particular visual judgement or decision making task. However, the effectiveness of a visualisation may be intrinsically related to, and difficult to distinguish from, individual-level factors such as visualisation literacy. Complicating matters further, visualisation literacy itself is not a singular intrinsic quality, but can be a result of several distinct challenges that a viewer encounters when performing a task with a visualisation. In this paper, we describe how such challenges apply to experiments that we use to evaluate visualisations, and discuss a set of considerations for designing studies in the future. Finally, we argue that aspects of the study design that are often neglected or overlooked (such as the onboarding of participants, tutorials, training, etc.) can have a big role in the results of a study and can potentially impact the conclusions that the researchers can draw from the study.
