We are always on the lookout for top students and researchers to join our lab. See below for information for potential postdoctoral scholars, Ph.D. students, and Master’s or undergrad research assistants or volunteers.

Not a prospective student or postdoc? Contact Jessica or Matt directly with speaking engagements or other requests.

### Prospective postdoctoral scholars

If you have or are soon to graduate with a Ph.D. in computer science or a related field and have a demonstrated publication record in top visualization or HCI venues, contact Matt or Jessica to discuss possible postdoctoral positions.

### Prospective Ph.D. students

Students who want to work with the lab can do so by applying to a Northwestern Ph.D. program.

[Computer Science](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/academics/graduate/phd/), or <br/>
[Technology & Social Behavior](https://tsb.northwestern.edu/admissions/), a joint Ph.D. program between Computer Science and Communication.

Our ongoing interests include generalizing discrete outcome visualizations of uncertainty, integrating prior knowledge in visualization interaction,  techniques for representing uncertainty, multiple views, and Bayesian statistics. Check out the lab’s work prior to applying so you can tell us concretely how your interests or experience intersect.

We encourage applications from students with degrees in computer science and related fields, but welcome applicants from all backgrounds. Applicants are expected to have a strong interest in HCI and visualization research. Being comfortable developing software and using statistics are important.

If you are unsure if you are qualified or have questions about working with the lab group, please get in touch.

The admissions deadlines are: December 15 for Northwestern University's CS Division, and December 31 for Northwestern University's TSB program.

### Existing undergraduates and Master’s students

Existing undergraduates and Master’s students at Northwestern should contact Matt or Jessica directly about possible opportunities to work on research in the lab. Be ready to explain what skills you can bring to the lab and describe your interests relative to our existing work.
